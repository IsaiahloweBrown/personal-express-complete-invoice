**Tech used:** CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, EJS, Express, MongoDB

The pomodoro app allows you to add a pomodoro task. There is a timer to track your time on your tasks in the same place. Once, you have complete a task you can click the check mark and it was go to the completed section. If you no longer want to complete the task, you can delete it with the trash day.



## Features in the Future:



- Background changes randomly every few seconds
- I want the user to be able to change the background or dark mode
- I want to include a simple refresh button for timer
- I will allow the timer to run even after page reload



## Lessons Learned:

I learned that coding is involved critical thinking to meet a goal but there are ways to meet said goal. With that mind, I realize I need to focus on the goal and the route I should take.
